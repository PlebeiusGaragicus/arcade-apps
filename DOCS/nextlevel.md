Alright, let's address the issue of balls going through the bottom of the screen first:

**1. Balls Going Through the Screen:**  
This can be due to the time step of the physics simulation being too large. If the time step is too large, the physics engine may not detect the collision in time, and objects might move through other objects. Try reducing the time step. However, this will increase the computational load, so you need to strike a balance.

In `PropertiesofNature.time_step`, try halving the current value and see if it improves the situation. If it does, but the performance isn't acceptable, you'll have to find a compromise between the two.

Another approach could be increasing the thickness of the boundary walls, making it less likely for the balls to pass through.

**2. Moving to the Next Level:**

For improving the performance and realism of your simulation, consider these optimizations and features:

a. **Optimize Collision Handling**: 
   - The current method of handling collisions (`handle_ball_collision`) does a search operation in the balls list for every collision. Consider storing the ball object as a property of the `pymunk.Shape` to make the retrieval faster.
   - You could set it during ball creation: `ball.shape.ball_object = ball`. Then, during the collision, you can directly access the ball objects with `arbiter.shapes[0].ball_object`.

b. **Screen Boundaries**:
   - Consider adding an elasticity to your screen boundaries if they don't have one. This will make the balls bounce off the edges more realistically.

c. **User Interactions**: 
   - Allow users to click and drag balls, giving them an initial velocity.
   - Implement pinch-zoom functionality for zooming in and out of the simulation.

d. **Visual Enhancements**: 
   - Use gradients for the ball colors to make the temperature difference more visually appealing.
   - Add effects like glowing for very hot balls.

e. **Performance**: 
   - Consider adding a quadtree or similar spatial partitioning algorithm for proximity checks. This can drastically improve performance by avoiding unnecessary distance calculations.
   - Periodically prune the `nearby_balls` list to remove balls that are no longer in proximity.

f. **Realism**: 
   - Introduce other physical properties like friction between balls, or even air resistance.
   - Add random external heat sources or sinks that can suddenly change the temperature of nearby balls.

g. **UI/UX**: 
   - Add a control panel where users can adjust parameters like gravity, air resistance, number of balls, etc., in real-time.
   - Show statistics like average temperature, number of collisions, etc.

Remember, while adding more features can make the simulation more interesting, it can also complicate the code and impact performance, so always ensure you're optimizing as you go.
