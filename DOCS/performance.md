From the profiling results, it appears that the major bottlenecks are in the proximity checking and heat transfer calculations between the balls.

Here are some observations and suggestions based on the profiling results:

1. **Proximity Checking**:
    - Most of the time is taken by the `game.py:88(update)` method.
    - The method `body.py:296(_get_position)` is called a significant number of times. This is because you are checking the positions of each pair of balls to determine if they are close to each other.
    - The `vec2d.py:306(get_distance)` method, which calculates the distance between two points, is also called very frequently.
    - **Solution**: Instead of pairwise checking, consider using a spatial partitioning algorithm or a library that does this. For instance, `pymunk` provides a spatial hash that can quickly query for objects near a certain position. This can drastically reduce the number of distance calculations required.

2. **Heat Transfer**:
    - The `game.py:112(handle_ball_collision)` method is responsible for handling the logic when two balls collide.
    - The `balls.py:78(compute_heat_transfer)` method is responsible for transferring heat between balls.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that heat transfer calculations only happen for balls that are in close proximity. However, from the results, it seems you are already doing this. It might be helpful to further optimize the formula or logic you are using for the heat transfer.

3. **Data Structures**:
    - Lists are great for many operations, but when frequently adding or removing items, they can become inefficient. If you are frequently adding or removing balls, consider using a `set` or another data structure more optimized for these operations.
    - However, if order matters (e.g., for rendering), you might need to maintain both a list (for order) and a set (for quick add/remove operations).

4. **Use Efficient Methods for Operations**:
    - Instead of using Python's built-in functions like `min`, `max`, `len`, etc., inside tight loops, consider using their NumPy counterparts which are more optimized.

5. **Parallel Processing**:
    - If calculations are independent, consider using Python's multiprocessing library to distribute the calculations across multiple CPU cores.

6. **Static Elements**:
    - If there are balls or elements that do not move or whose temperature doesn't change, consider flagging them as static and exclude them from regular updates.

7. **Optimize Render**:
    - Ensure that only visible or active elements are being rendered. Avoid rendering objects that are off-screen or inactive.

Lastly, always ensure that your optimizations do not compromise the accuracy or the intended behavior of your simulation. It's a balance between performance and accuracy.
